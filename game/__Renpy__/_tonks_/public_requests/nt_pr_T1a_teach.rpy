    m "Anything interesting happen today, [ton_name]?"
    ton "Did it ever... I broke new ground today..."
    m "That's what I like to hear... So what happened?"
    ton "Remember that cute little \"Slytherin\" that's still coming to grips with her budding sexuality?"
    m "The girl you're turning into a lesbian, got it."
    ton "Well, I had her stay back after class today..."
    ton "For someone who supposedly hates selling favours, she was surprisingly keen today..."
    m "Maybe she's finally coming around..."
    ton "Maybe... Anyway, we agreed on me getting a little peek under her skirt for 15 points..."
    ton "After she'd pulled up I did the old offer more points for her to drop her panties."
    ton "I was expecting her to at least argue for more points but she dropped them in an instant."
    ton "Next, she just looked at me as if to ask, \"what next?\""
    ton "Ugh... it was so fucking hot..."
    ton "So I was going to have her play with herself..."
    ton "But that cute face of hers... and all the teasing..."
    ton "I decided to take matters into my own hands... specifically her matter..."
    m "You couldn't help yourself, could you?"
    ton "Ugh... You wouldn't blame me for fingering her if you saw how cute she was."
    ton "And that look on her face... that perfect mix of lust and need..."
    ton "Fucking. incredible. "
    m "What did she have to say about the whole thing?"
    ton "Not much... She just looked up at me with those puppy-dog eyes whispering \"wow\" and \"don't stop\"..."
    ton "To think she tried to pretend she wasn't into me before..."
    m "Good work, [tonks_name]. Think she'll start talking now?"
    ton "Not unless she's ready to out herself as bi..."
    ton "But I think there are some whispers..."
    m "Very good. That'll be all then."
    ton "Thank you, sir... See you..."
